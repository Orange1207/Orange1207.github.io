Education
======
* **Beijing Normal University-Hong Kong Baptist University United International College (UIC)**  
  Sept 2022 – June 2026 (Expected)
  Major: BSc in Applied Mathematics    *GPA: 3.79/4.0 (Rank 2)* 
  Minor: BSc in Computer Science and Technology  

Reserch Experience
======
* **Team Member (Preparation for FYP, Mentor: Prof.Jianglun Wu) | Multiscale Cancer Modeling Project**  
  *Feb 2025 – Present*  
  - Developed a hybrid probabilistic model to study leader-follower cell migration in cancer invasion, combining Markov chains
for state transitions (e.g.polarity to dynamic states) and Poisson processes for timing of migration events.  
  - Incorporated environmental factors (e.g.FGF10 gradients) into transition probabilities, using experimental data to calibrate
model parameters.
  - Explored the impact of cell-cell interactions and chemical cues on metastatic potential through agent-based simulations.
  - Proposed preliminary strategies to predict high-risk migration paths and potential therapeutic targets.
  - Search for multiple median data to validate model predictions against live-cell imaging data.
    
* **Research Assistant ( Mentor: Dr.Jiaqi Zhang ) | A Fluid Mechanical Study of Rotation-induced Traumatic Brain Injury**  
  *Feb 2025 – Present*  
  - Read papers on rotation - induced traumatic brain injury to understand cerebrospinal fluid’s role  
  - Analyzed different density ratios and created scatter plots to explore their impact on related factors
    
* **Research Assistant ( Mentor: Dr.Jiaqi Zhang ) | Olympic Preparation Technology Research Project: Development of the Third Generation Intelligent Selection Arrow Equipment and System**  
  *June 2024 – Oct 2024*  
  - Test archery experiments, and collect datasets (8 parameters) about the arrow’s ejection motion
  - Use Python for statistical processing of data and Matlab numerical integration for error estimation
  - Built regression models to observe their stability
  - Created visualizations, analysis how to optimize the selected arrow’s machine
